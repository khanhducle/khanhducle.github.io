# What are CBIR/image search engines?

We're all familiar with text based search engines such as Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo - you simply enter a few keywords related to the content you want to find (i.e., your "query"), and then your results are returned to you. But for the image search engines, things work a little differently - you're not using _text_ as your query, you are instead using an _image_

In general, there tend to be 3 types of image search engines: **search by meta-data**, **search by example**, and a **hybrid approach** of the two

# Search by Meta-Data
Search by meta-data is only marginally different the the standard keyword-based search engines mentioned above. Search by meta-data systems rarely examine the contents of the image itself. Instead, they rely on textual clues such as (1) manual annotions and tagging performed by humans along with (2) automated contextual hints, such as the text that appears near the image on a webpage.
